# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions. The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks proper error handling for scenarios such as database errors or non-existent users.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, demonstrating best practices for robust Express.js applications.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `bug.js` file.
3. Run the application using `node bug.js`.
4. Send a request to `/users/<invalid-id>` or simulate a database error.  Observe the incomplete or unexpected error response.

## Solution

The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage various failure scenarios.  The improved code handles database errors, and cases where a requested user is not found, returning appropriate HTTP status codes and user-friendly messages.
